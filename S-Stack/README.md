## STACK 

- A linear-data structure that follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
- It is useful when we need to store data in a particular order like... function calls during recursion
- It can be implemented using Array or Linked List. (Each has its own pros and cons. Try thinking yourself)
- Implementation of the basic operations like push, pop, peek etc  provided [here](StacksWithoutSTL.cpp).

Applications of stack :

1. Parenthesis Balancing
2. Infix to prefix or postfix conversion
3. To reverse a word or a string
4. _Call stack_ : To store list of functions that are either executing or waiting to be executed during runtime. ( stored in stack in memory)
5. Practical application : (<-)Back button present in a browser pushes the URLs of the visited sites on a stack.
