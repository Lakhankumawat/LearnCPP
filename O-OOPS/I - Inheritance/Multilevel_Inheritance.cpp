/*
Multilevel Inheritance in C++
	Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in which one derived class is inherited from another derived 
	class.
	For example, we have three classes “animal”, “mammal” and “cow”. If the “mammal” class is inherited from the 
	“animal” class and “cow” class is inherited from “mammal” which means that the “mammal” class can now 
	implement the functionalities of “animal” and “cow” class can now implement the functionalities of “mammal” 
	class.
