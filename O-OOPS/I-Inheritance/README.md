<h2>Inheritance in C++ an Overview</h2>

	-Reusability is a very important feature of OOPs  

	-In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it

	-Reusing classes saves time and money

	-Reusing already tested and debugged classes will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again

<h3>What is Inheritance in C++?</h3>

	*The concept of reusability in C++ is supported using inheritance

	*We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting it

	*The existing class is called a base class

	*The new class which is inherited from the base class is called a derived class

	*Reusing classes saves time and money

	*There are different types of inheritance in C++

<h3>Forms of Inheritance in C++</h3>

	*Single Inheritance

	*Multiple Inheritance

	*Hierarchical Inheritance

	*Multilevel Inheritance

	*Hybrid Inheritance

<h3>Single Inheritance in C++</h3>

	Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a derived class is inherited with only one base class.
