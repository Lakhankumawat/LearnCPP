Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over simple recursion.
Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming.
The basic idea is to simply store the results of  the subproblems, so that we do not have to compute it again and again them when needed later. 
This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial. 


### Recursive vs Dynamic Programming Approach :

#### Recursive:
```
int fibo(n)
  if n<=1
    return n;
  else
    fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2);
```


#### Dynamic Programming:
```
f[0]=0;
f[1]=1;

for i=2 to n
  f[i]=f[i-1]+f[i-2];

return f[n];
```

### Properties

- Overlapping Subproblems
- Optimal Substructure

### Advantages

- As it is a recursive programming technique, it reduces the line code.
- One of the major advantages of using dynamic programming is it speeds up the processing as we use previously calculated references.

### Disadvantage

- It takes a lot of memory to store the calculated result of every subproblem without ensuring if the stored value will be utilized or not.
- In DP, functions are called recursively. Stack memory keeps increasing.

# Equal Sum Partition Problem

# Problem Statement

Given an array you have to output true or false depending on whether the array can be divided into two subsets such that the sum of both the subsets is equal. 

        > Note this question is a variation of 01 Knapsack problem

## Examples
```
Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 11, 5}
Output: true 
The array can be partitioned as {1, 5, 5} and {11}

Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 3}
Output: false 
The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum sets.

```
# Explanation

- Consider you are given an array.

- Let's say the array is divided into two subsets P1 and P2 and sum of P1 is S1 and P2 is S2.

- Now the questions says that sum of both the subsets must be same i.e S1=S2=S.

- This means the sum of the original array should be S+S=2S (Even as the number is 2*Sum).
This implies that we can get two such subsets when the sum of the original given array is Even.

    - In example arr[]= {1,5,11,5}
    Sum of array is 1+5+11+5=22 which is even. 

    - In example arr[]= {1,5,3}
    Sum of array is 1+5+3=9 which is odd and an odd number can never be divided into two equal parts.

     > Here you have to divide the number as int so you cannot divide the number as 11.5 and 11.5

- So in the question we can first calculate the sum of the array and ***if(sum%2!=0)*** (i.e sum=odd) we can return false

 ``` C++
    int sum=0;
    for(int i=0;i<size;i++)
        sum=sum+arr[i];

    if(sum%2!=0)
         return false;

 ```

- Now if the sum is even then 
we need to find one subset whose sum is S/2 because if we can find one subset with sum =S/2 then there will always be another subset with sum=S/2 as the sum of whole array is S.

So we call the subsetSum function.

``` C++
    input:arr[i]
      int sum=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        sum+=arr[i];

    if(sum%2!=0)
         return false;

    else if (sum%2==0)
        return subsetSum(arr,sum/2,n);

```
- In subsetSum function the problem can be solved using dynamic programming when the sum of the elements is not too big. We can create a 2D array t[][] of size (n+1)*(sum/2 + 1). And we can construct the solution in a bottom-up manner such that every filled entry has the following property  
```
t[i][j] = true if a subset of {arr[0], arr[1], ..arr[j-1]} has sum equal to i, otherwise false

```

# Problem Statement


Given two strings s1 and s2, you have to output the shortest length of the string that has both strings s1 and s2 as subsequences.

     > Note this question is a variation of LCS problem

## Examples
```
Input:   str1 = "AGGTAB",  str2 = "GXTXAYB"

Output:  9

String "AGXGTXAYB" has both string 
"AGGTAB" and "GXTXAYB" as subsequences.

```
# Explanation

- Consider two strings S1 and S2.
```
S1= A G G T A B
S2= G X T X A Y B
```
- We need to find a string that has both strings as subsequences and is shortest such string.

- Shortest Supersequence for above example would be AGGXTXAYB

- Here we observe that if there are multiple occurence of any alphabet between the two strings(s1 and s2) then we write it only once (i.e GTAB).

- Now we know that GTAB is the LCS of the two strings.

- So to find the total length we calculate the size of both the strings and subtract the LCS of the string to remove second occurences.
```
Length of SuperSubsequence = (Length of string S1 + Length of string S2) - LCS(string S1, string S2)
```
``` C++
Input: string s1
Input: string s2
     m=size of s1
     n=size of s2
     return m+n-LCS(a,b,m,n)
```
```
s1: AGGTAB  
s2: GXTXAYB
s1=6, s2= 7, LCS=4 

    Ans 6+7-4=9 
```

# [Trapping Rain Water Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

=======
Consider a string str and output the minimum number of characters that need to be inserted to make it a palindrome. 

> This question is a variation of LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) problem


## Examples
```
Input: abcd
Output: 3
Number of insertions required is 3 i.e. dcbabcd

Input: abcda
Output: 2
Number of insertions required is 2 i.e. adcbcda 

Input: abcde
Output: 4
Number of insertions required is 4 i.e. edcbabcde


```
# Explanation

- Consider a string str: aebcbda
- We know that to make this string a palindrome we need to add a 'd' and an 'e' i.e  adebcbeda
- Here it can be seen that we needed to add 2 alphabets to make it a palindrome
- To find these we need to first find the LPS (Longest palindromic subsequence)
- To find the LPS find the length of LCS of the input string and its reverse
- From the LPS we can see that the minimum number of insertions needed would be the length of the input string minus LPS.
```
Number of insertions = Length of string - Length of LPS
```
So the function findMinInsertionsLCS would be
``` C++
    string rev = "";
	rev = str;
	reverseStr(rev);
	return (n - lcs(str, rev, n, n));
```

# [Trapping Rain Water Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

### Problem-Statement

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

### Examples

Input: arr[]   = {2, 0, 2}
Output: 2

We can trap 2 units of water in the middle gap

<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200429012104/Untitled-Diagram711.png" width="300" />



Input: arr[]   = {3, 0, 2, 0, 4}
Output: 7

We can trap "3 units" of water between 3 and 2,
"1 unit" on top of bar 2 and "3 units" between 2 
and 4.

<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200429012307/Untitled-Diagram811.png" width="300" />

### Explanation

An element of the array can store water if there are higher bars on the left and right. The amount of water to be stored in every element can be found out by finding the heights of bars on the left and right sides. The idea is to compute the amount of water that can be stored in every element of the array. 

- Algorithm(Pseudo Code): 

  - Create two arrays left and right of size n. create a variable max_ = INT_MIN.
  - Run one loop from start to end. In each iteration update max_ as max_ = max(max_, arr[i]) and also assign left[i] = max_
  - Update max_ = INT_MIN.
  - Run another loop from end to start. In each iteration update max_ as max_ = max(max_, arr[i]) and also assign right[i] = max_
  - Traverse the array from start to end.
  - The amount of water that will be stored in this column is min(a,b) – array[i],(where a = left[i] and b = right[i]) add this value to total     amount of water stored
  - Print the total amount of water stored.

- Space Optimization for the Solution: 

Instead of maintaining two arrays of size n for storing the left and a right max of each element, maintain two variables to store the maximum till that point. Since water trapped at any element = min(max_left, max_right) – arr[i]. Calculate water trapped on smaller elements out of A[lo] and A[hi] first and move the pointers till lo doesn’t cross hi.
